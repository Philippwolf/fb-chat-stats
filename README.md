This application is changing your facebook data into nice looking website with easy customizable themes.

## Where to go to download Facebook data?

Check out this page: https://www.facebook.com/help/www/405183566203254

## How to use this script?

First of all if you don't have BeautifulSoup, you need to install it by using 
```
pip instal bs4
```

If you already have bs4:

1. Go to /messages directory
2. Paste .html file from your downloaded Facebook data
3. Run script.py file
	- When asked for "Fb messages file" type file name WITHOUT extension
	- When asked for theme name type one of themes name in /themes directory
	- When asked for "Month language" type shortcut of your language (IT MAY NOT BE SUPPORTED, IN THAT CASE CREATE NEW ISSUE, OR EDIT /messages/months.json file and add your language )
4. Wait until script finish its work
5. Now in main folder you should have index.html file.

## How to contribute?

I will accept any help, but mostly I am looking for someone to create nice looking themes and add new months languages.
